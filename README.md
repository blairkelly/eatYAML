# eatYAML
Turn YAML into JSON.

I needed the YAML output of imagemagick processes in JSON format. The YAML parsers I found on NPM kek'd on the regular.

So... I wrote eatYAML.

I'm not sure this is to spec. It's not very smart or robust yet, but it does what I need it to do.

EatYAML.

Takes a YAML string. Spits out JSON.
